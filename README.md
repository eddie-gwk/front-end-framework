# Basic Project Framework

---

### introduce

This is a basic project framework that utilizes Vite for the construction framework, Vue as the base front-end framework, and TypeScript as the development language.

Integrated with the latest plugins:

- **ESLint**: A tool for finding and fixing problems in your JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter.
- **Stylelint**: A mighty CSS linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions.
- **Commitlint**: Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format.
- **PostCSS**: PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins.

### Usage

After pulling the code to the local, you will get a well-configured project. Use the following commands to start:

1. `pnpm i` - Install dependencies.
2. `pnpm run dev` - Start the development server.

Subsequent code development can be carried out on this basis.
